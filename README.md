# Enhanced Text Classification through an Improved Discrete Laying Chicken Algorithm
## ABSTRACT
The exponential growth of digital text documents presents a significant challenge for
text classification algorithms, as the vast number of words in each document can
hinder their efficiency. Feature selection (FS) is a crucial technique that eliminates irrelevant features and enhances classification accuracy. In this study, we
propose an improved version of the discrete laying chicken algorithm (IDLCA) that
utilizes noun-based filtering to reduce the number of features and improve text
classification performance. Although LCA is a newly proposed algorithm, it has not
been systematically applied to discrete problems before. Our enhanced version of LCA
employs different operators to improve the exploration and exploitation of this
algorithm to find better solutions in discrete mode. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method, we compared it with some conventional nature-inspired feature
selection methods using various learning models such as decision trees (DT), Knearest
neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM) on five
benchmark datasets with three different evaluation metrics. The experimental results
demonstrate the proposed algorithm's effectiveness compared to the existing
one.
